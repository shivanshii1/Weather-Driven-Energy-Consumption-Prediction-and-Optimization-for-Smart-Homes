# Weather-Driven-Energy-Consumption-Prediction-and-Optimization-for-Smart-Homes
This project utilizes machine learning to predict and  optimize energy consumption based on weather patterns, four ML  models are tested including Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and  Gradient Boosting.
The project effectively unveiled the substantial influence of weather variables, including temperature and humidity, on energy consumption trends.    This played a crucial part in understanding and optimizing energy usage.   
Moreover, the project's findings shed light on the environmental implications of our energy usage. When we consume more energy during extreme weather conditions, it can strain our energy resources and lead to further implications in the future. Thus we must pave the way for more sustainable practices.
